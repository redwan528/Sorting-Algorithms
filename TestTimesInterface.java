/**
 * 
 * This interface will be used to organize and manage test times that are measured for specific operations.
 * 
 * The user will utilze <code>System.nanoTime()</code> to measure the time it takes to complete an operation.
 * 
 * <p>Before the operation is started, you can obtain the start time:
 * <br>
 * <code>startTime = System.nanoTime()</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>After the operation is completed, you can obtain the end time:
 * <br>
 * <code>endTime = System.nanoTime()</code>.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Test Time is then:
 * <br>
 * <code>testTime = endTime - startTime</code>. </p>
